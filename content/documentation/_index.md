### BornAgain

BornAgain has two bodies of documentation:

* web-only documentation, accessible from this start page;
* the User Manual, available online or as PDF download.

The web-only documentation concentrates on practicalities: functionality and architecture overviews, installation instructions, tutorials and usage examples.
The User Manual explains the theoretical models and their implementation in BornAgain.
