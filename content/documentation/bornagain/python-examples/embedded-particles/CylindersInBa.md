### Cylinders in Born Approximation

Scattering from a monodisperse distribution of cylinders using the Born approximation.

* The cylinders are all identical with radii and heights equal to 5 nanometers.
* The wavelength is equal to 1 Å.
* The incident angles are equal to αi = 0.2° and Φi=0°.
* There is no substrate (particles are embedded in the air layer), hence no refraction, hence no distorted waves, hence DWBA boils down to regular Born approximation.
* Scattering is not affected by inter-particle correlations (dilute-particles approximation).
