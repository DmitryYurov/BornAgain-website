### Size-distribution model: Decoupling Approximation

Scattering from a distribution of cylinders of two different sizes using the Decoupling Approximation.

* The sample is made of cylinders deposited on a substrate.
* The distribution of particles is made of:
    * 80% of cylinders with radii and heights equal to 5 nm
    * 20% of cylinders with radii and heights equal to 8 nm.
* The interference function is Radial Paracrystal with a peak distance of 18 nm and a damping length of 1 μm.
* The wavelength is equal to 1 Å.
* The incident angles are αi = 0.2° and Φi = 0°.
