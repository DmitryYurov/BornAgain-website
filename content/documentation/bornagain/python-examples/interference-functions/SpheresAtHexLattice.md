### Spheres on Hexagonal Lattice

Scattering from spheres distributed along a hexagonal lattice.

* The sample is made of spherical particles with radii of 10 nm deposited on a substrate along a hexagonal lattice.
* This two-dimensional lattice is characterized by a lattice length of 20 nm. Its a-axis coincides with the x-axis of the reference cartesian frame.
* The wavelength is equal to 1 Å.
* The incident angles are αi = 0.2° and Φi = 0°.
