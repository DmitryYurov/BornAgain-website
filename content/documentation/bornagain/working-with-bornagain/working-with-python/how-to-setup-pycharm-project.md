### How to setup a PyCharm project

In this tutorial we explain how to setup a Python development environment to be able to create, modify and run BornAgain simulations using Python scripts. The tutorial is oriented towards Windows users who are making their first steps in scientific computing with Python.

At this point we assume that the user has already installed `BornAgain` and the `Anaconda` Python distribution as explained in the [installation section]({{% relref "documentation/bornagain/installation/windows" %}}). As the next step, we suggest you to install PyCharm - a free, lightweighted, multi-platform Python IDE - to be able to work with Python code in a convenient manner. Download PyCharm community edition from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download).

The rest of the tutorial explains how to setup Anaconda + BornAgain + PyCharm project for the first time.
